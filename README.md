# Arduino powered car heater timer.

2 and 3 pins is relay, i used two relays for 230v that I can make sure that my car starts to warm up even if the second relay breaks down, the intention was to test the relays later.

if you're thinking of doing something similar, I recommend using the millis variable to get a more accurate timing, here, of course, a few seconds won't hurt.
